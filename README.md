A better national firewall,



maybe the United States should have a firewall similar to the Great Firewall in China

to restrict US internet access nationwide only to ip's from countries that our allies or that are neutral

and block ip access nationwide to any other country that is not our known ally or considered neutral

this will help reduce security incidents in our country with the internet


people would still have international phone call access to call anywhere in the world if they want to call countries overseas

ONLY US government ips would have full blown internet access to connect to any ip in the world

but customer ip and business ips and private ips would filter through the national firewall
